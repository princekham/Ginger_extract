# Ginger_extract


When brewing ginger liquid extracted by a juicer to obtain ginger crystals, it's generally recommended to brew it at a relatively low temperature. Ginger's active components can be sensitive to heat. It's suggested to brew it at a temperature below boiling point, ideally around 140째F to 160째F (60째C to 71째C), allowing the liquid to simmer rather than reaching a rolling boil. This temperature range helps preserve the beneficial compounds in ginger while reducing the risk of degradation due to excessive heat.
